Major assignment
These are the changes I want to make.

Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
My chosen source of inspiration is the abstract artworks of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. Below are two examples I found:
There are several aspects of his work that I would like to incorporate into my artwork to meet the requirements of the assignment:
1.	I want to draw on elements common to Piet Mondrian's work: rectangles, straight lines and geometric shapes.
2.	I will be adopting Piet Mondrian's idea of using colour by using basic primary colours (red, blue and yellow) and neutrals (black, white and grey).
3.	I plan to incorporate a few dynamic effects into my artwork, such as changing position or colour to add visual interest.
Demonstrate my understanding and use of artistic elements and subject content to create a minimalist artwork.

Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
I anticipate using JavaScript and HTML5 to implement the artwork concepts I described in Part 1. HTML5 makes creating geometric shapes, lines, and colours accessible, and JavaScript creates animated effects, such as colour gradients or shapes moving around to enhance visual appeal. Both Coding Techniques are well suited for implementing Piet Mondrian-style geometric patterns.
